# OfficeChat

By Bohan Wu, Thomas Durkin

It is an integrated software that supports online file and slides editing, online communication, and online shared repository for professional office use. 

Tired of looking through slack, browsing through messy google drive, editing on google docs, and Message group chat? OfficeChat is your best bet.

We will integrate local area network to support file transfer under the same network. We will support online live group file editing using servers we built. We will support chat communication, voice calls, and video calls within the software. It is an ultimate integrated office software.

We chose GPL v3.0 license because we care about shared improvements. We would like to attract talented developers to work on it with us and share the great improvements within a small community. 

Our business model would be as follows. We will make the software open to public when we are testing and developing it. When it comes to the point of commerical release, we will ask if everyone who helped and developed this project wants to be share holder and make the project private. Then, we will make this project fully commerical and aim for profit. This is by far our assumption of how the project will go.
